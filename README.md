# Iteration vs Recursive

This repository compares the time efficiency of iteration and recursion algorithms for calculating factorial numbers in JavaScript. The analysis spans various input sizes, providing insights into the performance differences.

## Usage

- `index.js`: Contains JavaScript code for iterative and recursive factorial calculation.
- Adjust stack size with `node --stack-size=XXXX index.js` for larger inputs.
- Explore and compare execution times and considerations for each algorithm.

## Stack Size Calculation

The repository includes a function to calculate the size of the stack dynamically. You can find this function in index.js.
